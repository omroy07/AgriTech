## Issue Description

**Issue #1058:** Text overlaps and becomes unreadable when hovering over images

### Problem

When hovering over images and cards across multiple modules, animations and transforms caused text to overlap and become unreadable due to improper z-index layering.

### Solution

Implemented proper z-index layering management and improved content containment to prevent hover transforms from overlapping text elements.
