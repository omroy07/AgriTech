        <h2>Pest and Disease Management</h2>
        <p>
          Protecting crops from pests and diseases is crucial for ensuring
          healthy yields. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) offers a sustainable
          approach that combines various practices to manage pests effectively
          while minimizing environmental impact.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Understanding Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>
        <p>
          IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term
          prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of
          techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, and use
          of resistant varieties. Pesticides are used only after monitoring
          indicates they are needed, and treatments are made with the goal of
          removing only the target organism.

        <h3>2. Key Components of IPM</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitoring:</strong> Regularly inspect crops to identify
            pest presence and assess infestation levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prevention:</strong> Implement cultural practices like crop
            rotation, intercropping, and selecting disease-resistant varieties
            to reduce pest establishment.
